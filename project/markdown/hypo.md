# Hypothesis
This project is practical and can be used in real libraries but with better user friendly interface by including a GUI (Graphical User Interface) and more utility based on the needs of the library. For example the library can charge extra the user for keeping a book for more than a week. No program is ever complete, we can always make them better depending on our needs. 

This program will make it easier for libraries to keep a record of all the books in a library and the records of the library.
